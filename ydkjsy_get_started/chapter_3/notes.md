## Iteration

ES6 standardized a specific protocol for the iterator pattern. The protocol defines a `next()` method whose return is an object called an *iterator result*; this object has `value` and `done` properties, where `done` is a boolean that is `false` until the iteration over the data source is complete.

# Closure

Closure is when a function remembers and continues to access variables from outside its scope, even when the function is executed in an different scope.

# Prototypes

A prototype can be considered as a linkage between two objects; the linkage is hidden behind the scenes, though there are ways to expose and observe it. This prototype linkage occurs when an object is created; it's linked to another object that already exists.
