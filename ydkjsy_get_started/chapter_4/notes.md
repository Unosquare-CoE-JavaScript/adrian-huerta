## Pilar 1: Scope and Closures

`let/const` declarations have a particular error behavior called the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** which results in observable but unusable variables.

## Pilar 2: Prototypes

In JS we have the option to create objects directly and explicitly, without first defining their structure in a class.

## Pilar 3: Types and Coercion

It's important to know the *static typing* like TypesScript, but itÂ´s more important to know more deeply how the language itself manages value types.
