# What Is Javascript?

## Not All (Web) JS

There are some functions like `alert` and `console` that are not **in the JS specification**. They are just  functions and object methods.

## What´s in an Interpretation

JavaScript is a compiled language, meaning that any source code and JS engine are processed and verify before it executes.

## Strictly Speaking

- `strict mode` can be turned on per-function scope.
- If a file has strict mode turned on, the function level strict mode will be disallowed.
- All transpiled code ends up in strict mode, even if the original source code isn´t written with the pragma `strict mode`.
