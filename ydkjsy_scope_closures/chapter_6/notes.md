# Limiting Scope Exposure

## Invoking Function Expressions Immediately

An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression ) is useful when we want to create a scope to hide variables/functions.

## Function Declarations in Blocks (FiB)

When a functions is declared directly inside a block, it's called **FiB**

- Using `let` y `const` are **block-scoped**.
- Using `var` declarations are **function-scoped**.

FiB is not worth it, and should be avoided.
