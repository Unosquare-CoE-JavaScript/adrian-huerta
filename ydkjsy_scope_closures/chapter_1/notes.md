# WhatÂ´s the Scope?

## Compiling Code

Scope is primarily determined during **compilation**, so understanding how compilation and execution relate is key in mastering scope.

**Parsing:** Array of tokens and turning in into a tree of nested elements, which collectively represents the grammatical structure of the program.This is called an *Abstract Syntax Tree (ATS)*.

**Code generation:** Taking an AST an turning in into executable code. The JS engine takes the AST and turns in into a set of machine instructions.
